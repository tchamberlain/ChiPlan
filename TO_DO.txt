TO DO:


CURRENT WORKING ON 



-implement something that removes past events upon startup



PROBLEMS::

  	-when should i generate activity index for each categroy page???? on rendered is too late
  	-when I refresh an activity page, the current activity goes away, but maybe if i make current activity a global variable??	
  
  	-is there a  better way to get the encoded latlng of all events then just to do a big client-side update to add a geojson location  after importing all events? ideally could do this in the shell, or server side, as you take pre_activities to activities




Most important???

-check on how categories generated, seems to be an issue-----> -make sure your querying things that are double tagged for categories






    geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
    geocoder.geocode( { 'address': pin.location}, function(results, status) {
    if (status == google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK) {
            pin.lat = results[0].geometry.location.lat();
            pin.lng = results[0].geometry.location.lng();

            Meteor.call('post', pin, function(error, id){
                if (error)
                    return alert(error.reason);

                Meteor.Router.to('pinPage', pin);
            });
        } else {
            alert('Geocode was not successful for the following reason: ' + status);
        }
    




TO DO:

-calendar
-get psuedo distance searcher working
-make front page look better
-click hover on header
-put date in nicer form to disply
-make "remove" button for dash view rather than add button


To make the time search feature work:

-must update all of the start dates to include times




To do tonight:
-add feature that shows how many people are going!
-make the twitter/ fb / insta buttons actually do something


_____
invites!!!

	-they will enter their name, meaning when they sign in thru email or twitter, they will need to enter theoir name
		-so u have to store name as separate attribute in profile

	-then the event will show up in list of invited activities, on their home page


-possibly cheeating work around --> save invites in separate collection, then display that collection on user's dash
	-this could get hairy if we ever get around to having security things
