ERRORS TO FIX:

-Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to read the 'contentDocument' property from 'HTMLIFrameElement': Blocked a frame with origin "http://localhost:3000" from accessing a frame with origin "http://static.ak.facebook.com". The frame being accessed set "document.domain" to "facebook.com", but the frame requesting access did not. Both must set "document.domain" to the same value to allow access.
-GET https://s-static.ak.facebook.com/connect/xd_arbiter/xRlIuTsSMoE.js?version=41 net::ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE
-The "fb-root" div has not been created, auto-creating
