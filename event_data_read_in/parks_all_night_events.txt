Hurricane ,  Toy Car ,  Two Cents         Using oddball humor, experimental  animation, music, simmering drama and more, each of these short films uses the  city as a jumping off point to explore and illuminate different aspects of life  in Chicago and the artists? creative process in response to the demands of  modern urban life.             These nine films run the gamut  from absurd to heartbreaking and each presents a fresh take on something  familiar.  Common Decency  and  Elsewhere, the Survivors  turn  traditional animation on its head to arrive at something deeper and  Possessed by Paul James - Hurricane  uses  music to celebrate the joy and chaos of children and creative expression.  Toy Car  spins a dark family tale in  Chicago?s immigrant community, while  Knock   imagines a bleak, isolated post-contagion Chicagoland buoyed by a strange  message of hope.               Dissolve ,   An Entirely Ordinary Individual  and  Two Cents  are stories of the lives of  young Chicagoans opening up to the world around them, and becoming a part of the  city by forging connections with the people who need them, want them or have  wronged them. Quick-tongued and visually witty,  The Man  serves up two men who discuss the finer points of  everything without ever reaching a conclusion about anything. ]]></content:encoded><dc:creator>Jon,Ravenscroft</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2015 15:08:11 GMT</pubDate><ev:location>Revere Park, 2509 W.

Activism In, As and
Through Art 
   South Chicago: In Progress  and
 Love & Capitalism (Parts 1 and 2)  with  Come to Light  and  Redmoon Summer
Park Series  
     These films blur and then erase
the line between art and activism as they chronicle the lives, loves,
disappointments and dreams of everyday Chicagoans and explore the ways in which
creating art can soothe the city?s collective soul.

  
      South Chicago: In Progress  plumbs the storied former steel-mill
neighborhood of South Chicago, giving voice to the lifelong community members
now living in the shadow of a proposed development. One-on-one interviews with
residents, activists and the developers chart a dialogue between the forces
that shape progress in the neighborhood to investigate the paradoxes, questions
and challenges intrinsic in attempting urban revitalization in this contested
area.

  
     Chicagoans from neighborhoods
across the city come face-to-face with the camera in  Love & Capitalism (Parts 1 & 2)  as they frankly discuss the
people they have loved and their complicated and conflicted relationships with
capitalism in a series of disarmingly honest street interviews. Equal parts
examination of and love letter to the city, this film sheds light on the stark
differences and striking similarities from neighborhood to neighborhood and
explores how class affects what a person believes, how they love and if they?re
happy with today?s society. ]]></content:encoded><dc:creator>Jon,Ravenscroft</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2015 15:06:16 GMT</pubDate><ev:location>Russell Square Park, 3045 E. 83rd St., Chicago IL         60617</ev:location><ev:startdate>2015-07-26T20:30:00</ev:startdate><ev:enddate>2015-07-26T22:00:00</ev:enddate><guid isPermaLink="False" xmlns="18447" /></item><item><title>Night Out: Chicago Onscreen Showcase at Union</title><link>http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/events/Night-Out-Chicago-Onscreen-Showcase-at-Union/?F_d=07/26/2015</link><description>   </description><content:encoded><![CDATA[   Chicagoland Thumbnails: Short Films from  the Windy City      Common Decency ,  Dissolve ,   Elsewhere the Survivors ,  An Entirely Ordinary Individual ,  Knock ,  The Man ,   Possessed by Paul James ?

These nine films run the gamut  from absurd to heartbreaking and each presents a fresh take on something  familiar.  Common Decency  and  Elsewhere, the Survivors  turn  traditional animation on its head to arrive at something deeper and  Possessed by Paul James - Hurricane  uses  music to celebrate the joy and chaos of children and creative expression.  Toy Car  spins a dark family tale in  Chicago?s immigrant community, while  Knock   imagines a bleak, isolated post-contagion Chicagoland buoyed by a strange  message of hope.               Dissolve ,   An Entirely Ordinary Individual  and  Two Cents  are stories of the lives of  young Chicagoans opening up to the world around them, and becoming a part of the  city by forging connections with the people who need them, want them or have  wronged them. Quick-tongued and visually witty,  The Man  serves up two men who discuss the finer points of  everything without ever reaching a conclusion about anything. ]]></content:encoded><dc:creator>Jon,Ravenscroft</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2015 15:07:15 GMT</pubDate><ev:location>Union Park, 1501 W.

In the wordless  Private Eye , a young private detective is captivated by the allure of his mark as he observes her from afar. As she leads him on an unexpected journey through Chicago, he discovers that not all is as it seems.      The Curse of the Tempest Jewel  reinvigorates a traditional film noir setting, 1940s Chicago, with an cast of seventeen actors with Down syndrome. As the private detectives and denizens of the city, the ensemble cast embark on a quest for the legendary Tempest Jewel, lost at sea centuries earlier.

Activism In, As and  Through Art      South Chicago: In Progress  and   Love & Capitalism (Parts 1 and 2)  with  Come to Light  and  Redmoon Summer  Park Series         These films blur and then erase  the line between art and activism as they chronicle the lives, loves,  disappointments and dreams of everyday Chicagoans and explore the ways in which  creating art can soothe the city?s collective soul.              South Chicago: In Progress  plumbs the storied former steel-mill  neighborhood of South Chicago, giving voice to the lifelong community members  now living in the shadow of a proposed development. One-on-one interviews with  residents, activists and the developers chart a dialogue between the forces  that shape progress in the neighborhood to investigate the paradoxes, questions  and challenges intrinsic in attempting urban revitalization in this contested  area.             Chicagoans from neighborhoods  across the city come face-to-face with the camera in  Love & Capitalism (Parts 1 & 2)  as they frankly discuss the  people they have loved and their complicated and conflicted relationships with  capitalism in a series of disarmingly honest street interviews. Equal parts  examination of and love letter to the city, this film sheds light on the stark  differences and striking similarities from neighborhood to neighborhood and  explores how class affects what a person believes, how they love and if they?re  happy with today?s society. ]]></content:encoded><dc:creator>Jon,Ravenscroft</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2015 15:11:12 GMT</pubDate><ev:location>Loyola Park, 1230 W.

Festival 
   Love
& Capitalism (Parts 1 & 2)  (Indoor screening with workshop)

                   Come to
Light ,  Dissolve, An Entirely Ordinary Individual ,  Get Involved ,  Offsides ,  Two
Cents  
     The  Reel2Real Festival  features
eight short films that engage with and inspire teens and young people.
Co-curated by a group of Chicago Park District teens, this lineup explores some
of the myriad pressures and pleasure of young life in Chicago and encourages
young people to take heart and take action.

  
     Chicagoans from neighborhoods
across the city come face-to-face with the camera in  Love & Capitalism (Parts 1 & 2)  as they frankly discuss the
people they have loved and their complicated and conflicted relationships with
capitalism in a series of disarmingly honest street interviews. This exiting
film will be presented indoors, at 6:00, with an accompanying workshop and
discussion.

        Dissolve ,  An Entirely
Ordinary Individual ,  Offsides  and
 Two Cents  are stories of the lives of
young Chicagoans opening up to the world around them, and becoming a part
of  the city by forging connections with
people they barely know and the people who need them, want them or have wronged
them.  Come to Light  documents the
design and installation of a public mosaic and chronicles the effect their
involvement in the process has on a collection of young artisans, and  Get Involved  follows a similar theme as
young people use music to urge their peers to step into community service. ]]></content:encoded><dc:creator>Jon,Ravenscroft</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2015 15:03:21 GMT</pubDate><ev:location>Lake Shore Park, 808 N.

This natural space is, in a way, made possible by the large industrial area that once surrounded it making a space where other urban sounds of traffic, business, and people, is not directly present.The Songpath at Hegewisch Marsh will be a companion to the Cowboys and Vikings project performance at neighboring American Steelworkers Park (NOIP in late September).]]></content:encoded><dc:creator>AmericanEagle.com,Admin User</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2015 06:32:51 GMT</pubDate><ev:location>, ,   </ev:location><ev:startdate>2015-08-30T12:00:00</ev:startdate><ev:enddate>2015-08-30T14:00:00</ev:enddate><guid isPermaLink="False" xmlns="18087" /></item><item><title>Night Out: Midsommer Flight at Lincoln</title><link>http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/events/Night-Out-Midsommer-Flight-at-Lincoln2/?F_d=08/30/2015</link><description>Shakespeare is cool and our outdoor free performances are a great way to spend your summer.
