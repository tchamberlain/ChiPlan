Instead of herding musicians and listeners into a one-size-fits-all downtown park, the Hyde Park Jazz Festival would present artists in unconventional spaces neatly suited to their work. Locations such as Frank Lloyd Wright’s Robie House and the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute, among others, were transformed into jazz dens where listeners could hear the music under nearly ideal acoustical circumstances.

With over 5,000 players all time, it is one of the most successful street games in the world with runnings in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, Vienna, and of course, Chicago!
This is a footrace–only your own two feet and public transit are permitted. No bicycles, no skates, no cars, no taxis. You will meet at a pre-determined meeting place. There you will receive a map and two ribbons. One will be red. One will be blue. The blue one will be placed on your arm. The red one will go in your pocket. Beginning at 7:00pm you will follow the map across the city trying to make it to the secret checkpoints as quickly as you can. All the while you’ll be chased by robots wearing red ribbons. If you get caught, you will hand over your blue ribbon as a prize to the chaser. You will take the red ribbon out of your pocket and place it around your arm. You are now a robot. The object of the game is to get to checkpoints without getting tagged or to catch as many runners as you can.

The first Hyde Park Jazz Festival, in September 2007, was created to bring new audiences into the many arts and cultural organizations in Hyde Park and to celebrate jazz’s great legacy and bright future on Chicago’s South Side.  Over 5,000 jazz fans enjoyed 12 hours of free, nonstop jazz played inside many of Hyde Park’s museums, theaters, art centers and cultural venues as well as the James W. Wagner Main Stage performances on the Midway Plaisance on the University of Chicago campus.  In only five years the Hyde Park Jazz Festival has established itself as one of the premier annual musical festivals in Chicago – named Best Neighborhood Music Festival by Chicago Magazine.  This year the Jazz Fest expands to 2 days and 20 hours presenting Chicago’s greatest jazz musicians to an anticipated crowd of over 20,000 jazz lovers.  The Hyde Park Jazz Festival is co-produced by the Hyde Park Alliance for Arts & Culture and the Hyde Park Jazz Society with Music Producer Carolyn Albritton.

The first Hyde Park Jazz Festival, in September 2007, was created to bring new audiences into the many arts and cultural organizations in Hyde Park and to celebrate jazz’s great legacy and bright future on Chicago’s South Side.  Over 5,000 jazz fans enjoyed 12 hours of free, nonstop jazz played inside many of Hyde Park’s museums, theaters, art centers and cultural venues as well as the James W. Wagner Main Stage performances on the Midway Plaisance on the University of Chicago campus.  In only five years the Hyde Park Jazz Festival has established itself as one of the premier annual musical festivals in Chicago – named Best Neighborhood Music Festival by Chicago Magazine.  This year the Jazz Fest expands to 2 days and 20 hours presenting Chicago’s greatest jazz musicians to an anticipated crowd of over 20,000 jazz lovers.  The Hyde Park Jazz Festival is co-produced by the Hyde Park Alliance for Arts & Culture and the Hyde Park Jazz Society with Music Producer Carolyn Albritton.

Instead of herding musicians and listeners into a one-size-fits-all downtown park, the Hyde Park Jazz Festival would present artists in unconventional spaces neatly suited to their work. Locations such as Frank Lloyd Wright’s Robie House and the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute, among others, were transformed into jazz dens where listeners could hear the music under nearly ideal acoustical circumstances.

The neighborhood developed in the late 1880s, largely through the efforts of Potter Palmer, who built an imposing ""castle"" on Lake Shore Drive, designed by Cobb & Frost. He purchased large tracts of land in the area and built dozens of houses which were sold to Chicago's wealthy class. The neighborhood has retained its stature as Chicago's premier neighborhood to the present day.
